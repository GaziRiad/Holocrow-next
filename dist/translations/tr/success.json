      "text": "The Directorate of Forestry in Türkiye used photo-capture devices across the country to protect forests from illegal activities and theft. Initially, these devices weren't centrally managed and used various email types for sending data, which was inefficient. After implementing Holocrow Enterprise, a centralized system with a standard sender address structure was established. This system transformed into an IoT platform for managing 4,000 devices, treating each as an individual 'thing.' With asynchronous architecture, it efficiently handles data capturing and processing using AI. If any real object (like humans, animals, or vehicles if vehicle then type, plate number, make-model, and color) is detected, the system sends an alert with proof snapshots to the relevant staff via email.",

Holocrow Enterprise operates to provide digitized data for various purposes, including visitor analytics, crowd analysis, passenger counting, parking space availability and violation tracking, garbage detection, and the identification of fire, smoke, and water levels. This is achieved by analyzing 2,500 cameras simultaneously, feeding valuable data into smart city platforms.",

The system detects ice cream products that are taken or left in the cabinet. When the sold quantity reaches half of the box's threshold, an automatic order for the relevant SKU type is generated, triggering Unilever's ERP system. Additionally, by analyzing hand movements, a heatmap is created for each cabinet. This selling data is then combined with the heatmap data, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior at the point of sale.",
